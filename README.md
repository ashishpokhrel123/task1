# Advanced Single Page Application Development

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app. Unlike traditional multi-page applications (MPAs) where each action or page request triggers a full reload, SPAs use JavaScript to fetch new data and update the user interface (UI) without requiring a page refresh. This leads to faster, more fluid interactions that feel more like a native application.
